    <p id="bio">
        My name is Kevin Miller. I am 28 years old and live in Chicago. I graduated from DePaul University with a degree in Economics in 2014.
        Prior to this course I had been working in finance for Northern Trust Corporation for six years, managing a small team valuing 401ks and pensions on a daily basis.
        I have always been interested in computers and technology and began learning some coding on my own and with friends a year or so ago.
        I am more than excited for this course and to continue learning!
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games (CSGO mostly), reading, watching sports, and spending time with my cat and fiancee.
